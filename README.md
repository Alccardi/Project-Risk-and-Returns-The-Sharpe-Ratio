# Evaluating Risk and Returns with the Sharpe Ratio
Utilize Python's pandas tool to compute and contrast the profitability and risk associated with various investments through the Sharpe Ratio.

## Unpacking the Sharpe Ratio
When deciding whether to allocate funds to an asset, it's essential to consider not only potential gains but also the level of risk involved. The Sharpe Ratio, conceived by Nobel laureate William Sharpe approximately half a century ago, accomplishes precisely that. It juxtaposes an investment's return against an alternative and establishes a connection between the relative return and the investment's risk, gauged by the standard deviation of returns.

## Particulars
In this project, I employ the Sharpe Ratio to analyze actual financial data using pandas.
